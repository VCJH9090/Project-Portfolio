## Design of an Improved Knee Joint for Simple Prosthesis
### Backgroundsds
<b>Kinematics and Machine Design Laboratory</b> is a class taken in University of Nebraska Lincoln. The final project was about creating an improved design of a knee joint of a prosthetic leg. 

### Details
Collaborated with two members to create a prosthetic knee joint through the usage of SolidWorks only with references from research papers and websites.

The kinematics of the knee joint was designed using a method called "<b>two-position synthesis</b>".

Essentially, created a four bar linkage to mimic a biological knee joint leading to a developed concept design.

After a few iterations of modifications and considerations, a finalized design of a nine bar linkage prosthetic knee joint was created within SolidWorks.

## ATS Assistive Walking Cane Tracker
### Background
<b>Assitive Technology Solutions, Inc</b> is a company that creates medical devices based from feedback from customers to assist limited mobility people or their caretakers.

### Details
Collaborated with two other volunteered members with the ATS company to build an assistive tracking device to track health of elderly patients based on their number of steps taken weekly and posted data onto a simple website.

Built a real-time tracker with utilizing Arduino, JavaScript, HTML, and SolidWorks to establish links between ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, WebSocket, UNIX time zone, and created website within three to four months within a semester.

## Light Following Robotic Arm
### Background
<b>Robotics Kinematics & Design</b> is a class taken in University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The requirement for the final project was a hypothesis-driven to touch upon the current-challenges in the robotics field.

### Details
Through the usage of photoresistor, the robotic arm would have the ability to move towards a target payload by detecting light source without the requiring a computationally expensive computer vison system.

Collaborated with two members to formulate Arduino code to program robotic arm to move iteratively towards the light source with a photoresistor attached on the end-effector. 

Using inverse kinematics to track position of its end-effector, relative to its base, and check for workspace boundaries conditions. 

Using an iterative algorithm, utilized x, y, and z gradients to move the end-effector of the robotic arm towards the light soure based on the increase and decrease in resistance of the photoresistor.

## Path-Guiding Multi-Robotics System
### Background 
<b>Cyber Physical System</b> is a class taken in Boston University. The final project was about creating a "cyber" and "physical" system with a purpose and motivation to tackle a particular problem in a real scenario. 

### Detail
Collaborated with three members to develop a "Tele-Operating" agent to guide a "Task" agent to its optimal parking spot, hosting electrical charging station for electric vehicles within an unknown parking lot environment.

Initiated a robotics system with ROSMASTER X3 (Yahboom) and implemented ROS Melodic to excute SLAM, move-base navigation stack, and QR camera detection.
